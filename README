# Week_2_traffic_data_warehouse
# Data warehouse tech stack with Postgresql, DBT, Airflow

## Introduction

Me and my colleagues have joined to create an AI startup that deploys sensors to businesses, collects data from all activities in a business - peopleâ€™s interaction, traffic flows, smart appliances installed in a company.
ourstartup helps organisations obtain critical intelligence based on public and private data they collect
 and organise. 

## Objective
Our objective is to reduce the cost of running the client facility as well as to increase
the livability and productivity of workers by creating a scalable data warehouse
tech-stack that will help us provide the AI service to the client.


## Challenges
    Since I'm not familiar with the terms mentioned, combining Airflow, dbt, and Redash turned out to be tough because it needed a lot of time and resources. Setting up and connecting these different tools required careful planning of settings and connections, making the integration process more complicated.
